TitleGetter.py isn't really asynchronous, there are big problems with how state
is saved.  Will move to a ClientFactory, no more coding on the Agent subclass.

'First Post' tracking - remember who posted a url first and include that data
with subsequent title responses.

!seen support, including populating database with historical data from the old
perl version.

!karma support, including populating database with historical data from logs.

Ignore support with interface for chanops.

'Ignore' support for urls/titles.  Need to be able to provide a means to block
urls by regex and titles by regex.

!say support.

Cookie support is rudimentary, nothing is done with path or domain values, all
received cookies are resent with each subsequent request.  Needs to be made more
robust, probably using an existing lib.
