TODO:

Convert alternate incoming encodings to unicode.

'First Post' tracking - remember who posted a url first and include that data with subsequent title responses.

Cookie support is rudimentary, nothing is done with path or domain values, all received cookies are resent with 
each subsequent request.  Needs to be made more robust, probably using an existing lib.

!seen support, including populating database with historical data from the old perl version.

!karma support, including populating database with historical data from logs.

Ignore support with interface for chanops.

'Ignore' support for urls/titles.  Need to be able to provide a means to block urls by regex and titles by 
regex.

!say support.
